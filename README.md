AlgoViz:
Real-Time Algorithm
Visualization and Learning
Introduction:
AlgoViz: Real-Time Algorithm Visualization and Learning is an interactive, web-based tool designed to help users understand and visualize the working of various sorting algorithms and fundamental data structures. The platform allows real-time algorithm visualizations, enabling users to grasp the mechanics of algorithms and data structures through dynamic, step-by-step animations. This tool is aimed at students, educators, and developers who seek a hands-on approach to learning algorithms.
Key Features:
•
Sorting Algorithms Visualization: Real-time animations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
•
Data Structure Visualizations: Dynamic views of Queue, Stack, and Linked List.
•
Binary Tree Traversals: Supports in-order, post-order, and pre-order tree traversals.
•
Graph Visualizations: Includes Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path finding.
•
Algorithm Comparisons: Allows side-by-side comparisons of different sorting algorithms.
•
Time and Space Complexity Analysis: Provides complexity metrics for all visualized algorithms.
•
Code Snippets: Displays the algorithm code alongside its visualization for better understanding.
•
Problem-Solving Questions: Includes algorithm-related questions for students to solve, encouraging practical learning.
Technology Stack:
1.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2.
